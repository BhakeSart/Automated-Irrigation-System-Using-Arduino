# Automed-Irrigation-System-Using-Arduino

This Project was designed and developed in my 2nd Semester . This Project has been assembled using Circuit Simulation Software Called [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/). <br>
The main micro-controller used here [Arduino Uno](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-A000066-ARDUINO-UNO-R3/dp/B008GRTSV6) . It is very useful for small scale , college level automation projects as it is very to program and the interfacing is very convenient. 

## Components Used

1. Arduino Uno
2. Soil Moisture Sensor
3. Ultrasonic Sensor [HCSR-04]
4.
